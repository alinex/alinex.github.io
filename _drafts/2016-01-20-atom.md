title: First Steps using Atom Editor

I worked with lots of editors from simple editors to complex IDEs. All have their
pros and cons. Lastly I did a lot using sublime_text but as a JavaScript developer
I had an eye on Atom since it grows up. Because it was officially only available
as 64bit software I had to wait.

As I tested the Atom editor by myself I made this blog entry to show how to use it
and it grew to a helpful reference for myself.


Installing Atom
================================================================================
That was an easy task under LinuxMint I downloaded and installed the debian package
from [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/). Everything went smooth and I could just
add some more packages through the integrated package management like:

- git-plus
- coffee-navigator
- coffee-paste
- linter-coffeelint
- linter-coffee-variables
- minimap
- markdown-pdf
- pdf-view

And I did step over the setup dialog, to look what I may have to setup.


Using Atom
================================================================================
At first it is very easy and a lot like sublime. The major shortcut to know for
a command search is: `Ctrl+Shift+p`

Additionally the following may be helpful:
- `Ctrl-<` will toggle the file tree view


Editing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Move Line**

`Ctrl-Up` / `Ctrl-Down` moves the current line or selected lines up/down


Code Specific Helpers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Markdown**
- `Ctrl-Shift-M` shows a rendered preview (realtime)


Using Git
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Modify**

- `Ctrl-Shift-A`: adds new files
- `Ctrl-Shift-A C`: commit changes (give a message and save `Ctrl-S`)
- `Ctrl-Shift-A P`: add all changed files and commit + push to remote
