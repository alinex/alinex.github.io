Time is going on and nearly everything in the IT will get more bloated over the Time
but my notebook never grows. So just now I was developing on a machine on which I
had to close the browser and editor so that I can run some unit tests.

My old notebook is a Samsung R505-Aura from 2008 with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 and
2GB RAM. Now I got an Acer Aspire E5 with i7 and 8GB RAM.
