title: Major Release of Config
layout: post
tags: Config
---

Just now the new [Config](https://alinex.github.io/node-config) module becomes
ready to use. It is a complete rewrite to support the new validator and make the
setup more powerful. It is also changed to add a proper update ans watching
of log resources later.

The major changes are:

- new setup mechanism
- more supported formats
- format auto detection
- use new validator

This version is not backward compatible because the setup and also the access
method are completely changed. Also because the used validator is updated all validation rules
have to be rewritten.

Details of changes
------------------------------------------------------------------

I only describe the major changes in it's core. See the links below for more information.

### Setup

### Formats

### Auto detection

### Validator

The [Validator](https://alinex.github.io/node-validator) has recently changed
and as this is a main part of a configuration the new version is supported now.
See the see [Release Information](http://alinex.github.io/2015/07/03/validator.html)
to get more details on this part.

Future changes
------------------------------------------------------------------

I plan to add watch functionality with auto reload and listener support.
Also the supported web formats will be extended.
