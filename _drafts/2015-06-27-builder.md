I will give you a short overview of how I manage my packages using a Linux
machine.


## What is Builder?

In short the [Builder](http://alinex.github.io/node-builder) is a set of helper
commands for development of node packages. Realized as a superset of npm and other
command line tools.

It may help a lot while developing to automatize the consequently done tasks with:

- easy to use build tool
- supporting complete process
- specialized for the alinex modules
- usable for other modules, too
- working with multiple packages at once

The following description is based on the use of this library.


## Planing

First step of each new project is the planing phase in which I will at first collect
my thoughts of what I need to do.

> I found [Freeplane](http://www.freeplane.org/) to be the optimal tool to bring

> and presentable.

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>This shows how I first collect the main features/parts of the application together
    keeping my details in the brain.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <img src="/images/2015-06-27-builder/mm-phase1.png" class="img-responsive center-block" />
  </div>
</div>

Now I extended this mind map with lots of details some may have a lot more
details as shown here.

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>But as always before you create anything new look if somebody has already made it
    and check if this may fullfill your needs. Often you find the thing you want to
    create already in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM Registry</a> so check it out and
    decide if you may use this, extend it (through a wrapper or fork) or if it really
    does not what you need and make it yourself.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <img src="/images/2015-06-27-builder/mm-phase2.png" class="img-responsive center-block"/>
  </div>
</div>

If I decided to really create something new I will note the basic API in my
mind map.

<img src="/images/2015-06-27-builder/mm-phase3.png" class="img-responsive center-block" />

Now it contains the functional information on the right side and the conceptual
API on the left. This is the basis for my further coding.


## Create a new Package

First if you don't have it install node.js ([howto](http://alinex.github.io/node-alinex/src/doc/install.md.html))
and then the builder using:

``` sh
sudo npm install -g alinex-builder --production
```

Now you can call the `builder` from anywhere on your system to create a new package
from scratch. This will create:

* the directory
* make some initial files
* init git repository
* setup github repository
* add and commit everything

> Before I start keep in mind that all my packages are named `alinex-...` to have an
> own name range and not get into conflict with existing modules later when publishing.

``` sh
builder ./node-mypackage -c create --package alinex-mypackage
```

In this line I call the builder with a till now not existing directory `node-package`
where I want to create my new module. The command `create` with the package name
`alinex-mypackage`

This process is interactive and will ask you some more details. After that you
may directly start to add your code.

``` text
prompt: Should a github repository be initialized?:  (yes)
Init new git repository
prompt: GitHub username::  (alinex)
prompt: Password for GitHub login::
prompt: Give a short description of this module.:  My test package.
Create new GitHub repository
Connect with GitHub repository
Create new package.json file
Create new README.md file
Create new changelog file
Create new travis-ci configuration
Initial commit
Push to origin
```

This will do the most part and create you a complete stub to start with.

To use travis-ci, coveralls and gemnasium later go to the links in the new
README.md and make your accounts there and enable the Github repository. For
coveralls I get a new security key (per package) which I have to set in the
`.travis` file to allow trusted connection to coveralls.

You will find a package with the following structure on your disk:

``` text
alinex-application/
  src/
  test/
  .gitignore
  .npmignore
  README.md
  Changelog.md
  package.json
  coffeelint.json
  travis.yml
```

To install the basic dependent packages I will run the installation just now:

``` sh
npm install
```

That will download and install all defined dependencies within a newly created
`node_modules/` subdirectory.


## Coding

First of all I take the mind map from above and start creating the parts step by
step. Sometimes if I want to mark what already is done I'll use the progress
tools from Freeplane to mark it like shown below.

<img src="/images/2015-06-27-builder/mm-coding.png" class="img-responsive center-block" />

Keep in mind that this is the process for a new project/package. Bugfixing and
extending existing code is managed in other forms.

> While coding I'll hang on my style and structure definitions of code and documentation
> described under the [General docs](http://alinex.github.io/node-alinex).

The coding itself goes on part by part and mostly:

1. I write the __user documentation__ out from the API documentation. This explains
   the short thoughts of the mind map further in the `README.md`.
2. Out of the examples given there and the mind map API and features the appropriate
   test cases for [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/).
3. The real code is written and tested till the test cases succeed.

__Writing Tests__

Test should be made for the whole API and every feature within that. I won't test
each function standalone (like the pure unit tests) but I prefer to make functional
tests which also covers every function through these.

I also prefer to not use stubs if they are not really necessary. In my opinion the
best case should be as near to the user as possible.


## Repository

As seen above in the creation process mostly I use a git repository to store my
work. I try to make atom commits with a short explanation as description. Through
the nature of git this is also possible if not connected to the Internet.

For a new project and if I am the only developer I won't use branches to make it
easier for me. But I tend to develop on different machines so I have to merge
and synchronize the code therefore. This is done by the [Builder](http://alinex.github.io/node-builder)
using the following two commands:

``` sh
# call this from the project's directory to get the latest changes
builder -c pull

# call this from the project's directory to push the changes to origin
builder -c push
```

Best practice for me is to push everything to the origin server (mostly Github)
before finishing work and to pull everything before starting work on another machine:

``` sh
# call this from the project's directory to get the latest changes
builder ../node-*  -c pull

# call this from the project's directory to push the changes to origin
builder ../node-* -c push
```


## Test the Code

All tests should be done automatically through mocha to allow continuous integration.
The tests should cover

Linting
Mocha Tests
Coverage

## Continuous Integration

travis
coveralls

## Publish new Version

version management
publish npm
create docs
publish docs

# Update documentation
