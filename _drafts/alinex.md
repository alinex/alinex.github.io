title: Alinex Goals

The code developed under the label Alinex was used as a testing environment at
the start. But always with high quality on modern and clean code. I will not
make any time stress and are not developing on fixed road map here.

Since about eight years I developed this modules here, at first under PHP and
Java. But for my private developments here I have now switched to JavaScript & Co
since over a year. Code has since then be rewritten multiple times but the good
concepts are kept like in the [Validator](http://alinex.github.io/node-validator)
which also existed in a [PHP Server](http://alinex.de/server/html/index.html)
which was a long time ago.

It changed often in the years and a lot of other projects are successors of this.
But now this project itself should be finished to build a complete basis for the
next projects.

## Goals

Alinex should be a collection of stable, flexible and strong integrated components
to make a base system for any powerful application. Web applications are used more
and more also with the new term 'software as a service' and the big market share of
tablet computers and smartphones.

To reach this there are already a lot of frameworks which help in development,
but often they are very complex and not flexible enough. The hardest part in web
applications is often to support the server side and the client side the same way.
Most frameworks lack in the one or the other part. Alinex aims this and will
in the long term support both. But not everything will be programmed, as far as
possible existing third party code will be integrated or supported.

Also I won't create the one system which can do nearly everything but better make
multiple modules which can be combined and may do everything if used together.
