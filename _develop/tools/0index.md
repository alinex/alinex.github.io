This section collects help about the different tools for development.

Editor / IDE
-------------------------------------------------

You may use any IDE you want but as I tested some of the popular free ones I
had little till no support for CoffeeScript, Jade and other modern dialects.
So you may use some generic IDEs like Eclipse or NetBeans with less support or
some simpler Editors which often at least has a working syntax highlighting.

I for myself used Sublime_Text a longer time but switched to Atom, now:

- [Sublime_Text](sublime.html)
- [Atom](atom.html)


Other Tools
-------------------------------------------------

- [git](git.html) - Version Control
- [npm](npm.html) - Node Package management
