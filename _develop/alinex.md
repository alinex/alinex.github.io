title: What is Alinex?
layout: develop
---

Just now it is a modular, flexible and powerful tool set for applications.
It aims to help the developer to create individual solutions in a fast and easy
but stable way.


Why I created it?
-------------------------------------------------

As I got more into the concept of node.js I found out that this is the ideal
solution for the alinex platform. I use this project to check new technologies
out and hopefully bring it more on the way than my php server part just now.

I worked further on creating a modular system with some of the great modules
available. Hardest thing is to find the best module for each job out of the
great repository.
With this project I went to new land (for me) in the web technologies and tried
lots of the current propagated technologies an patterns out.


Roadmap
-------------------------------------------------

There is no real roadmap for the time and functionality. It all depends on my
personal time and interests. But I will give a short overview of the big
points, what is planned for this year:

- hardening base modules
- optimizing documentation
- more applications

See the [Planning Board](https://trello.com/b/lOY5hCx7/node-js) for more up to
date information of there I'm working at. Also the [Ideas](src/doc/ideas.md)
page will hold some general ideas and thoughts.
