_My first experience with rust!_

I decided to dive into a new language, a compiler language this time. So I decided between
`Go` and `Rust`. This document describes the result of my experience using `rust`.


Installation
--------------------------------------------
I installed it on my local machine using:

    $ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

The installation told me that it will use the directory `/home/alex/.cargo/bin` for
the new binaries and will add this to my profile's search path.
But it only did so for `.profile` so I had to add it to `.bashrc` the same way by hand.

That was all.


Setup
--------------------------------------------
As editor I firstly use Atom with the following additional packages:
- language-rust
- linter-rust


Resume
--------------------------------------------
Without many details hier I come to an early end with my experiences after learning
the syntax and diving into some real codes from github.

All together this language is (in the moment) to low level for me. I have to do too much
of the basics on my own to get a working http server in example.

`Rust` as I see it now is really a replacement for `C` to make the core code. What I
am looking for is something to base stable and reusable networking components on it.
More like the superior NodeJs.

Maybe I will come again and realy start using this language but more for some core parts.
