title: Typesafety in JavaScript

Like stated in my previous post I start a new major version of some of my modules
in the newest JavaScript style. Therefore I would also have some point of type
safety within my code without to much trouble.

# Possibilities

I found the two big possibilities:
- TypeScript
- Flow Annotations

Both are similar in a lot of points. They both change the code to not be regular
JavaScript and use the additional information to check. To run the code they need
a transpiler which converts it to regular JavaScript.

# Solution

As Flow integrates nicely into my current Babel setting and uses a babel preset to
get rid of the annotations it works fine with me. I found it also better adjusted in
my editor and ESLint.

So I start to use Flow in all my new files. Read more about under
[Testing](https://alinex.gitbooks.io/nodejs/develop/test.html).
