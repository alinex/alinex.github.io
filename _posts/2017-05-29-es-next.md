# Programming in ES.Next

After working some time using CoffeeScript I started a new round of modules. This
time using native JavaScript but with itÂ´s newest standards.

These are:
- ECMAScript 2015 (nearly complete in Node 6.x)
- ECMAScript 2016 (since Node 7.5)
- ECMAScript 2017 (partly in Node 8.0 nightly)
- ECMAScript 2018

See the [supported features](http://node.green/).


## Documentation

My first step to this goal was to decide what tools I use and how to configure them
to work optimal for my development environment. All my findings and conclusion
are written down in a [GitBook](https://alinex.gitbooks.io/nodejs).


## Next steps

While I start to write the first parts of my new modules I am still learning and
optimizing the documentation about that.
