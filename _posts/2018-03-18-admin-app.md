Since my postings in January I slowly got forward and now reached milestone four.
You heard nothing from me in february but that won't mean that I stopped working...

## Goals reached

- The server is running great with propper logging for debugging, too.
- Authentication on the server is enabled using mongo database.
- The client was rewritten with the new Quasar Framework V 0.15.
- A proper layout is set.
- Menu structure set up for modular system.
- Login/logout in client possible with error management.
- Display server/client information for debugging as data table.

## Status

I'm happy so far. The project is going the right way.

## Next steps

I have some more milestones planned before I can declare the system as basically ready.
Next will be to make pages secure (only for authenticated users), integrate internationalization and a chat application as first real module.
