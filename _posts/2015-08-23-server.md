I made some small web applications which include the server part but they are
all build by its own. No complete common base not really configurable for the
operations team.

Idea
------------------------------------------------------------------

So I thought about making a wrapper around a core web server component and add
support for:

- external runtime configuration
- live debugging
- customizable logging
- plugable interface
- server management

All that at first only for an HTTP/HTTPS server but open to add other protocols
like FTP later.

Basic HTTP Server Select√≠on
------------------------------------------------------------------
Here I looked over multiple modules and made a comparison between
[Express](http://expressjs.com), [Koa](http://koajs.com) and [HapiJS](http://hapijs.com/).
I already worked with express but found HapiJS to be the best choice for such an
base module in the enterprise range.

Because Hapi is really different from the others I had to test a lot to get familiar
with it. But now I like all the features it brings out of the box.

Concept
------------------------------------------------------------------
The server should work directly with:

- multiple IP addresses
- multiple ports
- different protocols (http/https)
- multiple domains (virtual hosts)
- and multiple context spaces

Further the following base features have to be included:

- logging / debugging
- authentication
- forwarding / redirects
- proxy support

Connectors and Binding
------------------------------------------------------------------
The server has two different bindings, first it should bind to the network to get
the requests. Second it allows binding plugins to specific requests.

![Architecture](http://alinex.github.io/node-server/src/doc/architecture.png)

**Network binding**

The listeners will bind to the network while the spaces makes areas on them to be
seen as one for configuration.

**Plugin binding**

Plugins maybe connected to listeners or spaces or parts of them. They add specific
abilities or applications to the server and make its content.

Plugins
------------------------------------------------------------------
Out of the box the server contains some basic plugins which may be configured:

### Logging

Allows to define log file of different formats to be written or also add mail or
http webservice logging. Maybe more transports are added later.

### Static files

Deliver static files as they are to the client with support of caching.

### Authentication

Allow different authentications like Basic, Password, IPbased. Many more are
possible later.

### Redirects/Forwarder

Allow redirect or forwarding of diffferent URLs.

### Reverse Proxy

Allow proxying of other web applications,

Status
------------------------------------------------------------------
Till now the very basic of the server is running. But not all of the basic plugins
are added. I plan to finish this work in the next weeks and also give some more
concrete examples of use.
