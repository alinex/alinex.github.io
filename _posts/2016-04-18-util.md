title: Util package reworked

The [Util](http://alinex.github.io/node-util) package is used nearly everywhere
in my packages. I use the string methods, but mostly the object.extend() and
object.clone() methods. But lastly I came across some bugs in this two methods.

The clone() method is calling extend() and this will extend and clone together.
But now I found out that it will neither extend proper nor clone properly. It
always do something in between. Also the extend method got two siblings
extendArrayConcat, extendArrayReplace to try to fix some needs.

As I got a closer look on the code I decided to make a rework of this two methods.
In this the clone() method should clone any object as far as possible and without
problems. But the extend() method should only extend and use with references.
But has different operation modes which define how to extend. Both can be used
separately or combined to get the current behaviour.

Because this is a breaking change I made a new major version. The old methods are
deprecated but still available. The new methods can be called as top level methods.
To make the util package complete I added the nodejs util.inherit() function, too.
It is possible to use this as a replacement of the default util package.

In the end the new methods got completely working. They are really powerful, see
it's description and are nearly 100% unit tested.
