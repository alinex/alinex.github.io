Till now this site was good but not good enough. I want to make it better.
Therefore I started to change some things and will go on for the next days.

Restructure of this site
===================================
I will divide this site into three parts:

1. The code presenting my packages and linking to other useful packages.
2. The blog, you read now, which should get more frequent information.
3. The develop guide a successor of the blog collecting the how-tos.

This three areas are now created and will be filled up the next days.

Within the blog I plan to write more often but also shorter articles.


Alinex Module
====================================
This holds most parts of the develop Guide just now and will get empty after
moving and updating them. But it should now be made a central module for some
alinex specific things. More information will come...
