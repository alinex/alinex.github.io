title: Automatic Documentation Extraction

Since some time I use [docker.js](https://github.com/jbt/docker) to generate my
code documentation. Because it lacks some style settings I had some postprocessing
added on the files to optimize the result.

That worked till now but I want to go a step further and make my documentation better.
The development of docker is nearly going to a halt short before the new major
version is going final. So I decided to go into the project in the hope of speeding
development up. I offered help and started analyzing the code.

But as more as I red I got the idea of making it the alinex style. So I decided
to give it a try and created [docode](http://alinex.github.io/node-codedoc). This
should be a parallel version and I try to add the fixes to the original docker, too.


Base concepts
==================================================================
At first I wanted to make it possible to generate a proper manual. Therefore
the follwoing steps should be done:

- convert markdown
- extract block commets as markdown
- extract block comments with javadoc like help
- add code with highlighting and inline comments
