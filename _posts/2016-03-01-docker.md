title: API Documentation Generation
layout: post
tags: Builder

Since some time I used the [jbt/docker](https://github.com/jbt/docker) library for
API generation within the [builder](http://alinex.github.io/node-builder). It
used the python pygments library.

But as I heard of the new version (currently released as alpha 1) I had a deeper
look on it and was enthuastic to use caused by the use of Markdown-it. Some weeks
ago I used markdown-it myself to make the [report](http://alinex.github.io/node-report)
package.

So just to try it out I installed the alpha version into my builder. I had some
things to do but got it working and now released a version of the
[builder](http://alinex.github.io/node-builder) powered with it.

What I had to do to use it
---------------------------------------

As a first step I had to install it using:

    npm install --save docker@next dedupe

Dedupe is necessary because it is missing in the alpha-1 as a dependency But will
be included in alpha-2.

The document generation worked very well but I had to use a lot of time to port
my own style to the new version. Some things I had to change after the documents
are generated:

- create index.html to forward to README.md.html
- correct internal links to \*.html
- add for on github link
- add my own header with logo and global links
- add viewport meta tag for mobile display:
  `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`
- remove empty `<pre..>...</pre>` and tailing newlines within `<pre>` tags
  for a better style
- copy images from src folder

After all these steps are taken you see my results under:
[Code](http://alinex.github.io/code.html). Thios pages are made with the
builder, which automatically uploads them to my github pages.
