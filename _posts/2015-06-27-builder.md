I will give you a short overview of how I develop my Node.JS packages using the
alinex-builder on my Linux machine. The following overview gives a lot hints
on the overall process excluding the real coding.


## What is Builder?

In short the [Builder](http://alinex.github.io/node-builder) is a set of helper
commands for development of node packages. Realized as a superset of npm and other
command line tools.

It may help a lot while developing to automatize the consequently done tasks with:

- easy to use build tool
- supporting complete process
- specialized for the alinex modules
- usable for other modules, too
- working with multiple packages at once

The following description is based on the use of this library.


## Planing

First step of each new project is the planing phase in which I will at first collect
my thoughts of what I need to do.

> I found [Freeplane](http://www.freeplane.org/) to be the optimal tool to bring
> my thoughts into structure in minimal time and get them also neatly organized
> and presentable.

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="col-sm-6" style="padding-left:0">
    <p>This shows how I first collect the main features/parts of the application together
    keeping my details in the brain.
    <br />That's only some words on a very simple mind map but they are the big
    points which makes this package.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6" style="padding-right:0; padding-bottom:10px">
    <img src="/images/2015-06-27-builder/mm-phase1.png" class="img-responsive center-block" />
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="col-sm-6" style="padding-left:0">
    <p>Now I extended this mind map with lots of details some may have a lot more
    details as shown here. In the mind map you can go step by step into deeper
    levels and break it up till you get small and simple things.</p>
    <p>Also check that the size of the package is in the limits. If your map
    goes to big you may split it up in some parts into different packages which
    together makes your whole system. This makes it more maintainable.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6" style="padding-right:0; padding-bottom:10px">
    <img src="/images/2015-06-27-builder/mm-phase2.png" class="img-responsive center-block"/>
  </div>
</div>

That gives you a perfect base for the next step. But as always what fits for my
open source development not always fit your development process. If you have a
larger project with more people involved you better make a complete requirement
engineering to get complete user stories for your customers.

> Now, before you create anything new look if somebody has already made it

If I decided to really create something new I will note the basic API in my
mind map.

<img src="/images/2015-06-27-builder/mm-phase3.png" class="img-responsive center-block" />

Now it contains the functional information on the right side and the conceptual
API on the left. This is the basis for my further coding.


## Create a new Package

First if you don't have it install node.js ([howto](http://alinex.github.io/node-alinex/src/doc/install.md.html))
and then the builder using:

``` sh
sudo npm install -g alinex-builder --production
```

Now you can call the `builder` from anywhere on your system to create a new package
from scratch. This will create:

* the directory
* make some initial files
* init git repository
* setup github repository
* add and commit everything

> Before I start keep in mind that all my packages are named `alinex-...` to have an
> own name range and not get into conflict with existing modules later when publishing.

``` sh
builder ./node-mypackage -c create --package alinex-mypackage
```

In this line I call the builder with a till now not existing directory `node-package`
where I want to create my new module. The command `create` with the package name
`alinex-mypackage`

This process is interactive and will ask you some more details. After that you
may directly start to add your code.

``` text
prompt: Should a github repository be initialized?:  (yes)
Init new git repository
prompt: GitHub username::  (alinex)
prompt: Password for GitHub login::
prompt: Give a short description of this module.:  My test package.
Create new GitHub repository
Connect with GitHub repository
Create new package.json file
Create new README.md file
Create new changelog file
Create new travis-ci configuration
Initial commit
Push to origin
```

This will do the most part and create you a complete stub to start with.

To use travis-ci, coveralls and gemnasium later go to the links in the new
README.md and make your accounts there and enable the Github repository. For
coveralls I get a new security key (per package) which I have to set in the
`.travis` file to allow trusted connection to coveralls.

You will find a package with the following structure on your disk:

``` text
alinex-application/
  src/
  test/
  .gitignore
  .npmignore
  README.md
  Changelog.md
  package.json
  travis.yml
```

To install the basic dependent packages I will run the installation just now:

``` sh
npm install
```

That will download and install all defined dependencies within a newly created
`node_modules/` subdirectory.


## Coding

First of all I take the mind map from above and start creating the parts step by
step. Sometimes if I want to mark what already is done I'll use the progress
tools from Freeplane to mark it like shown below.

<img src="/images/2015-06-27-builder/mm-coding.png" class="img-responsive center-block" />

Keep in mind that this is the process for a new project/package. Bugfixing and
extending existing code is managed in other forms.

> While coding I'll hang on my style and structure definitions of code and documentation
> described under the [General docs](http://alinex.github.io/node-alinex).

The coding itself goes on part by part and mostly:

1. I write the __user documentation__ out from the API documentation. This explains
   the short thoughts of the mind map further in the `README.md`.
2. Out of the examples given there and the mind map API and features the appropriate
   test cases for [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/).
3. The real code is written and tested till the test cases succeed.

> The builder will help you in both, javascript and coffee-script code but because
> of readability and security I prefer to use coffee-script.

__Writing Tests__

Test should be made for the whole API and every feature within that. I won't test
each function standalone (like the pure unit tests) but I prefer to make functional
tests which also covers every function through these.

> I also prefer to not use stubs if they are not really necessary. In my opinion the
> best case should be as near to the user as possible.


## Source Repository

As seen above in the creation process mostly I use a git repository to store my
work. I try to make atom commits with a short explanation as description. Through
the nature of git this is also possible if not connected to the Internet.

For a new project and if I am the only developer I won't use branches to make it
easier for me. But I tend to develop on different machines so I have to merge
and synchronize the code therefore. This is done by the [Builder](http://alinex.github.io/node-builder)
using the following two commands:

``` sh
# call this from the project's directory to get the latest changes
builder -c pull

# call this from the project's directory to push the changes to origin
builder -c push
```

Best practice for me is to push everything to the origin server (mostly Github)
before finishing work and to pull everything before starting work on another machine:

``` sh
# call this from the project's directory to get the latest changes
builder ../node-*  -c pull

# call this from the project's directory to push the changes to origin
builder ../node-* -c push
```

More about the use of Git may be found in my short [HowTo](/node-alinex/src/doc/git.md.html).


## Test the Code

All tests should be done automatically through mocha to allow continuous integration.
Therefore the tests should be defined under `test/mocha/` in coffeescript or javascript.

To test your code call them using:

``` sh
# call this from the project's directory
builder ../node-*  -c test -v
```

Use the verbose flag `-v` to also display the linting information, too. The output
may look like:

``` text
Working on ./
run automatic tests
Linting coffee code
✓ src/index.coffee
  ✓ src/load.coffee

✓ Ok! » 0 errors and 0 warnings in 2 files
Run mocha tests

  Load
    origin
      1) should add origin

  0 passing (2s)
  1 failing

  1) Load origin should add origin:
     Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'apply' of undefined
    at src/load.coffee:120:39
    at src/load.coffee:110:11
    at src/load.coffee:174:14
    at src/load.coffee:230:9
    at parse (src/load.coffee:226:14)
    at parse (src/load.coffee:173:5)
    at src/load.coffee:105:9
    at evalmachine.<anonymous>:272:14
    at Object.oncomplete (evalmachine.<anonymous>:108:15)
```

First you see the linting which don't give any warning or error and then the tests
of one test, which failed. The Error with the stack trace is shown below.

### Linting

The linting will check that there is no syntax error and that the style guide is
fulfilled. In coffee-script that contains checks like:

- there must be spaces around arrows
- space after assignment operator
- braces needs spacing, too
- classes needs to use CamelCase syntax
- indentation has to be 2 spaces, tabs are not allowed
- lines may not be longer than 100 chars
- backticks are not allowed
- no unnecessary fat arrows
- debugger calls should be removed
- duplicate keys are not allowed
- and some more

> The cyclomatic complexity will not be reported because I don't think that it is
> the best indicator for the complexity in readability. As example the cyclomatic
> complexity of an switch statement is very high whilst it's readability is very good.
> And readability is the point that counts.

Warnings may be skipped but should be solved later but errors prevent the further
processing and have to be solved immediately.

### Code Coverage

To get a better code quality and check that the quality is good you may look at
the code coverage which shows you all the lines which are processed while running
the tests and also all the lines missing in the tests.

If there are lots of lines missing I forgot some tests and will add them.

To show the coverage report call:

``` sh
# call this from the project's directory
builder ../node-*  -c test --coverage --browser
```

This will create the report and opens it in the browser. THis will look like below:

<img src="/images/2015-06-27-builder/coverage.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" />


## Continuous Integration

In the next step I will test my code under different environments automatically
using continuous integration. Here [travis](https://travis-ci.org/) brings a free
service for github hosted projects. To use it everything was already done by
creating a `.travis.yml` file earlier. You only have to enable the service on
their website.

If you want you may also make an account on [coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)
which will show the current coverage which will be calculated on travis. This is
also added in the `.travis.yml` but you have to update the key with the one you
get after registering your package in coveralls.


## Publish new Version

After everything is done and works, you may publish a new version of your package.


``` sh
# call this from the project's directory
builder -c publish
```

The output will be:

``` text
push changes to repository
push node-builder
Push to origin
remote: This repository moved. Please use the new location:
remote:   https://github.com/alinex/node-builder.git
To https://github.com/alinex/node-make
   46f16d7..34a0a61  master -> master
cleanup files

   bfc73a0..1114a9b  gh-pages -> gh-pages
publish package in npm
publish node-builder
Change package.json
Write new changelog
Commit new version information
Push to git origin
remote: This repository moved. Please use the new location:

   34a0a61..0fef12e  master -> master
Push new tag to git origin
remote: This repository moved. Please use the new location:
remote:   https://github.com/alinex/node-builder.git
To https://github.com/alinex/node-make
 * [new tag]         v1.0.9 -> v1.0.9
Push to npm
Created v1.0.9.
Done.
```

Like seen above this will also push last changes, cleanup, reinstall the package
compile with compression and run all tests before publishing. And the documentation
will be updated afterwards, too.

For the next minor version (second number) call:

``` sh
builder ./node-error -c publish --minor
```

And for a new major version:

``` sh
builder ./node-error -c publish --major
```

And you may use the switches `--try` to not really publish but to check if it will
be possible and `--force` to always publish also if it is not possible because of
failed tests or not up-to-date dependent packages.

Now the new version is online and anybody can install it through npm.


### Version Management

I prefer to really use the concept of semantic versioning like described under
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).

- fixes and small improvements will only change the last number
- minor version (second number) changes when bigger features come, which are backward compatible
- and the major version if I change parts which make the version backward incompatible

One exception may be the version 1.0.0 which I will set if the package has a specific
level of stability and reached its complete functionality. This is sometimes done
without big changes only to show the current state.


## Update documentation

Now the last and final step is to bring the documentation online on my site.

``` sh
# call this from the project's directory
builder -c doc --publish
```

That's all: It will create the documentation set the style for the alinex doc
layout and put them alltogether online as github pages.

# Summary

Over the time I developed the helper tools on and on to get the tool set I described
above. It is born to simplify my tasks and I won't miss it anymore.

If you want to do it in a similar way don't hesitate to install the
[Builder](http://alinex.github.io/node-builder) yourself and check it out.
