title: Update of my personal Homepage
layout: post
tags: Quasar
---

After working with Quasar some time I had the idea to also use it for my personal homepage.

My [personal homepage](http://alinex.de) consists of only a single page with some short informations about myself. I use it as a introduction for everybody I communicate with to get to know me better.

It will be a client only quasar project and I use the Vue and Quasar technologies only to get some client side effects and produce a modern layout. The contents will be:
- short info
- biographia about myself
- some of my projects
- contact information

I will use a toolbar on top for the navigation, some rows of information, timeline and cards. The project cards should contain image slideshows (with fullscreen) and details about the project.
I also know that this site is not SEO kompatible but this is none of my goals here.

As of now, the basic structure is ready and working but I need to fill in more informations. So I will launch it at the end of easter holidays. Visit my page if you are interested, then.

Additionally you may find some information on my [developer site](https://alinex.github.io) which will be kept as it is for now.
