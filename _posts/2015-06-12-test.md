title: Using Jakyll & Bootstrap on Github
layout: default

To optimize my already on github hosted website I thought about using more of
the already installed and running Jakyll system.

So I read a lot about Jakyll and the newest version of Bootstrap to make a new
and modern website representing my web development. My hope was to get something
a web developer can easily maintain and use while working in the development
environment. It should also allow to easy upload using github pages.
