title: Using Jekyll & Bootstrap on Github
layout: post
---

I red about the Jekyll support on github and had to try it mysqlf. I already
have a small site on github but was not aware of the whole functionality which
was behind it.

So I read a lot more about Jekyll and the newest version of Bootstrap to make a
new and modern website representing my web development. My hope was to get something
a web developer can easily maintain and use while working in the development
environment and with the all to familiar tools.
