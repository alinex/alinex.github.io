Lately on my slower notebook with conventional disk (no SSD) Atom will get stuck for seeveral Minutes after starting. It is working but will not load or save. In the background is analyzing my codebase which has lots of files as everybody knows by using NPM modules.

As I lately often hear others speaking about VSCode I checked it out. 

## Installation

I decided to install it using a repository to make updating easy:

    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg
    sudo mv microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list'

Then update the package cache and install the package using:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install code # or code-insiders

## First Impression

Without reading anything about the editor I started using it. It is nearly self explaining. I had to install JavaScript and Vue module but looks like everything is there and running well. At first sight it feels really faster than Atom.

Shortcuts are similiar to Atom and GIT integration works also great out of the box.

I will use it the next days...
