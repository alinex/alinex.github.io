After working a long time on the new [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/alinex-validator)
module I got on to renew the next module.

My server module is something which was never ready to use in production but should be within the
next year. It should be a base server to deliver web sites, rest services and more.

## Planning

I used the last weeks to rethink the architecture and technologies. I also decided on a base server
module like Express, Hapi, Koa and more. I come to the decision to use [Hapi](https://hapijs.com) as
it is full featured and has the most possibilities to be customized.

## Roadmap

Starting from now a complete new module with a class based server module will be created. The first
features will be:
- listening on different ip/ports
- integrate plugins
- debugging and logging
- support http/https
- support virtual hosts

The next step will be to add some plugins for specific content and stabilize it:
- static data
- redirects/rewrites
- socket io

In the third step some view technologies will be integrated:
- swagger
- Angular
- Jade
- ...

## Goal

I plan to build some applications on this, later.
